GIFT-Cloud Uploader
-------------------

GIFT-Cloud is a secure data storage and collaboration platform for medical imaging research.

GiftCloudUploader is a Java Web Start application used to anonymise and upload data to a GIFT-Cloud Server.

GiftCloudUploader can be run as a standalone application on any computer. It can be used to upload data directly, and it can act as a Gateway Server. A Gateway server can receive data pushed from a Dicom device and automatically anonymise and upload the data to a GIFT-Cloud server, making it suitable for integrating a PACS with a GIFT-Cloud research server.
 
Authors: Tom Doel and Dzhoshkun Shakir, [Translational Imaging Group][tig], [Centre for Medical Image Computing][cmic], [University College London (UCL)][ucl].
GIFT-Cloud was developed as part of the [GIFT-Surg][giftsurg] project. 

GIFT-Cloud Server extends the [XNAT][xnat] system developed by Harvard University / Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) / Washington University.

 * GIFT-Cloud and XNAT are not certified for clinical use.

System requirements
-------------------

GIFT-Cloud Uploader connects to a GIFT-Cloud Server, or XNAT server running XNAT 1.6 or later. Please see [XNAT 1.6 prerequisites][xnatprerequisites].

GIFT-Cloud Uploader can be installed on Linux, macOS or Windows.

GIFT-Cloud Uploader requires:
 * Oracle Java SDK 1.7 or later
 * Maven


Development in IntelliJ IDEA CE
-------------------------------

IntelliJ IDEA CE (Community Edition) is a free Java IDE with built-in Maven support.
You can add a configuration which allows you to run or debug the application from within the IDE:

 * Click `File > Open...` and select the main repository folder
 * If give the option, choose `New Window`
 * IntelliJ IDEA should automatically detect the maven `pom.xml` and import the project.
 * Click `Add Configuration...`
 * Click `+` and select `Application`
 * Under `Name:` enter `Run GIFT-Cloud Uploader`
 * Under `Main class:` enter `uk.ac.ucl.cs.cmic.giftcloud.uploadapp.GiftCloudUploaderApp`
 * To run the application (without debugging), click the green arrow symbol to the right of `Run GIFT-Cloud Uploader`  
 * To run the application (with debugging), click the green bug symbol next to the run arrow to the right of `Run GIFT-Cloud Uploader`  





Compilation and deployment
--------------------------

 * GIFT-Cloud Uploader can only be compiled using Maven
 * If you wish to customise and compile GIFT-Cloud Uploader, you will need to create a code signing key to sign the application (Java Web Start cannot run unsigned applications)



Issues
------

If you experience issues installing or operating the GIFT-Cloud Server, please consult the XNAT documentation
 * Check the [XNAT documentation][xnatdocumentation];
 * Search the [XNAT discussion group][xnatdiscussion] as your issue will often have been reported by someone else;
 * If you can't find a solution, post a new message in the [XNAT discussion group][xnatdiscussion] and explain that you are installing a customised version of XNAT 1.6.

If you specifically have an issue with GIFT-Cloud Uploader
 * Please check you have the correct version of Java installed
 * Please check your firewall is configured to allow connection to your GIFT-Cloud Server
